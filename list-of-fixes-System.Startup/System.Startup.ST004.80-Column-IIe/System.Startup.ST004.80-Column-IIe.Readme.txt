Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Boot Side Code Changes
======================================================

From Thomas William Ewer's reverse engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) of Wizardry it is now possible to fix the game code itself.


Bug/Issue #:	ST004 - 80-Column IIe
======================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	04-Jan-2023

The Issue:	A bug where on an Apple //e (or //e emulator) with an 80-column card in the aux slot, Wizardry would incorrectly switch to 80-column mode and have weird spacing between all characters and lines on the screen. To fix this, memory location $B91D was changed from a JMP instruction ($6C) to a RTS ($60). This prevents Wizardry from attempting to switch out of 80-column mode, which was actually causing it to switch into 80 columns on an Apple //e.

The Fix:	Hex edit the value 6C to 60. Update the release date.	

Why this fix:	To have Wizardry running in 40-column text mode on an Apple //e or emulator. Sector editing is the only way to accomplish this for now until someone comes up with a better solution.

Source Disk:	Wiz1E.dsk

File:		OPTIONS.TEXT

Sector Editing:
		Start your favorite sector editor
		Insert the Wizardry Boot disk
		Search for Hex 6C F6 00
		Replace Hex 6C to 60
		Note: This can be reversed if you wish or as needed.

Segment:	PROCEDURE OPTIONS;  (* P070301 *)
