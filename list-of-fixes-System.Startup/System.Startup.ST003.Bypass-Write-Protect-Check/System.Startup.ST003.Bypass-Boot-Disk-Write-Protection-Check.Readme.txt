Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Boot Side Code Changes
======================================================

From Thomas William Ewer's reverse engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) of Wizardry it is now possible to fix the game code itself.


Bug/Issue #:	ST003 - Boot Disk Write Protection Check
========================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	25-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: Thomas W. Ewers, Chris Torrence)

The Issue:	If the write-protection tab on a physical diskette, or the read-only flag on a diskette image, is not on then game will go to a blank screen and stay in an infinity loop right after the game boot splash screens.

The Fix:	Remark out the write protection check code to bypass it.	

Source Disk:	Wiz1E.dsk

File:		OPTIONS.TEXT

Segment:	PROCEDURE OPTIONS;  (* P070301 *)

Code From:

    UNITREAD( DRIVE1, IOBUFF, SIZEOF( IOBUFF), 0, 0);
    UNITWRITE( DRIVE1, IOBUFF, SIZEOF( IOBUFF), 0, 0);
    
    IF IORESULT <> 16 THEN
      REPEAT
      UNTIL FALSE;

Code To:	Putting the code between "(* " and " *)" makes it a remark and thus it is skipped, therefore bypassing the write protection check. 

    (* ST003 REMARK OUT/BYPASS BOOT DISK WRITE-PROTECT CHECK *)
    (* UNITREAD( DRIVE1, IOBUFF, SIZEOF( IOBUFF), 0, 0);
    UNITWRITE( DRIVE1, IOBUFF, SIZEOF( IOBUFF), 0, 0);
    
    IF IORESULT <> 16 THEN
      REPEAT
      UNTIL FALSE; *)

Final Compiled File Name:	SYSTEM.STARTUP

Destination Disk:		Any Wizardry Proving Grounds boot disk.
